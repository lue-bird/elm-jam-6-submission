## brainstorm

game rules are an illusion – they only exist in your head based on your previous intuition
  - game world but you can drag&drop everything "let the ball reach the right side!"
      - level
        → drag the ball to the right
      - level. Way for ball blocked off by un-passable red block
        → drag the red block above the ball to the left
      - level. An area marked green that the ball can't leave
        → drag the green box closer to the right
      - ? level. Right blocked off by a red block that's passable
        → drag the ball to the right
  - birds with wings fly by, you can drag their wings to your body
